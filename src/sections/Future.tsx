        <p>
            For the future, my goal is to familiarize myself with development on RTOS platforms (specifically Zephyr RTOS).
            Iâ€™m hoping to develop some networking applications for RTOS that would improve connectivity for IoT devices
            running on RTOS. Another goal of mine is to pursue electrical design and hopefully create an ASIC to perform
            high-speed packet (potential capstone incoming?). This project has a lot of hopefuls, but in general, I want to
            continue working on networking projects at the low level.
