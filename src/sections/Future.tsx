        <p>
            For the future, my goal is to familiarize myself with development on RTOS platforms (specifically Zephyr RTOS).
            Iâ€™m hoping to develop some networking applications for RTOS that would improve connectivity for IoT devices
            running on RTOS. Another goal of mine is to pursue electrical design and hopefully implement high-speed
            packet processing at the hardware level with an FPGA (potential capstone incoming?). This project has a lot
            of hopefuls, but in general, I want to continue working on networking projects at the low level.
